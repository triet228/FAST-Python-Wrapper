# FAST Python Wrapper

Python wrapper for running [Future Aircraft Sizing Tool (FAST)](https://github.com/ideas-um/FAST) through MATLAB Engine.

## Files

- `wrapper.py`: core wrapper around MATLAB Engine and FAST.
- `main.py`: direct script that runs FAST-Python_Wrapper
- `examples/<Aircraft>/inputs/InputAircraft.json`: merged aircraft and mission input data.
- `examples/<Aircraft>/outputs/`: aircraft output data.
- `contracts/InputAircraftSchema.json`: JSON Schema for merged input aircraft JSON.
- `contracts/OutputAircraftSchema.json`: JSON Schema for output aircraft JSON.


## Requirements

- A local FAST directory
- Use a virtual environment with a Python version that is compatible with MATLAB Engine on [MATLAB Official Website](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html). Edit [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/triet228/FAST-Python-Wrapper/blob/main/pyproject.toml) to match the correct python and matlabengine version.

> [!WARNING]
> Please make sure your Python version is compatible with MATLAB Engine and it's reflected in both your virtual environment and [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/triet228/FAST-Python-Wrapper/blob/main/pyproject.toml).


## Installations

1. Clone this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/triet228/FAST-Python-Wrapper) to your machine.

2. Confirm Python version is compatible with MATLAB Engine. Edit [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/triet228/FAST-Python-Wrapper/blob/main/pyproject.toml) to match the correct python and matlabengine version.
> [!WARNING]
> Please confirm your Python version is compatible with MATLAB Engine on [MATLAB Official Website](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html)

3. Install dependencies:
> [!TIP]
> Command line can be run in VS Code Terminal
```
pip install -e .
```

4. Check that Python can import MATLAB Engine:
```powershell
python -c "import matlab.engine; print('MATLAB Engine OK')"
```
If this gives error, you will need to debug this before continue. If this prints `MATLAB Engine OK`, the environment is ready.
> [!WARNING]
> One bug might be that your Python version is not compatible with MATLAB Engine. Please check on [MATLAB Official Website](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html). Edit [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/triet228/FAST-Python-Wrapper/blob/main/pyproject.toml) to match the correct python and matlabengine version. Then redo step 4 `pip install -e .` to install dependencies.

> [!TIP]
> Inside MATLAB, you can run `which matlab` to know where MATLAB is installed.


## How to Run

Edit directories at the very end of `main.py`
```python
INPUT_DIR = <Your input directory>
OUTPUT_DIR = <Your output directory>
FAST_DIR = <Your local FAST directory>
```

Run `main.py`
```bash
python main.py
```
